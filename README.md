## About
Chess is a fully functional C++ application with a graphical interface built using SFML. It features complete rule enforcement, object-oriented architecture, and a responsive GUI that allows users to play chess against each other in real time. The project demonstrates hands-on experience with C++ programming, system design, and interactive graphics, while showcasing problem-solving skills in implementing game logic, state management, and collision-free rendering.

## Features
- *Complete Chess Rules:* Enforces legal moves, captures, turns, and check/checkmate detection.
- *Object-Oriented Design:* Modular architecture modeling board state, pieces, and game flow for easy scalability.
- *Interactive GUI:* Responsive interface built with SFML for rendering sprites and handling user input.
- *Move Validation & Testing:* Systematic testing of edge cases ensures correctness and prevents illegal moves.
- *Cross-Platform Potential:* Can be compiled on any system with a C++17 compiler and SFML library.
### Future Planned Additions
- Chess bot
- Real time multiplayer

---
## Tech Stack
- *Programming Languages:* C++
- *Libraries & Frameworks:* SFML
- *Tools & Platforms:* Git/GitHub, Virtual Studio

## Usage
- This project is a C++ chess game with a graphical interface built using SFML.
- Users can play a standard game of chess with legal move enforcement, captures, and turn management.
- The GUI allows players to interactively click and move pieces on the board, with real-time updates.
- To run the project yourself, you would need a C++17 compiler and the SFML library installed. Compilation instructions can be added later. (.exe will be included in the future)
- Even without running it, you can explore the code to see game logic, object-oriented design, and graphics handling in action.
